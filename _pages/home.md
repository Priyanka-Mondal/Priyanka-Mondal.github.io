<b> Hello there, I'm Priyanka !! Welcome to my personal website. </b>  

Currently, I am working towards my PhD at the [UCSC](https://www.ucsc.edu/about/){:target="_blank"}. 
I am advised by [Prof. Owen Arden](https://owenarden.github.io/home/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Ioannis Demertzis](https://idemertzis.com){:target="_blank"}. 
My research lies in the intersection of language-based security, security in distributed systems, 
and applied cryptography. Specifically, I am interested in information flow policies, 
fault tolerant systems and searchable encyption. At UCSC, I am an active member of 
[Women in Cyber Security](https://www.wicys.org){:target="_blank"} 
and [Women in Science and Engineering](https://wiseucsc.wixsite.com/wise){:target="_blank"}, 
advocating for diversity and excellence in science and technology.
Before joining UCSC, I worked as a software engineer for the Networking & Cloud team
at [Citrix R&D, Bangalore](https://www.citrix.com){:target="_blank"}, for two years. Prior to that, 
I acquired a masters degree from the esteemed [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, where I worked with [Prof. Aditya Kanade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-kanade-572113139/){:target="_blank"} in [Software Engineering and Analysis Lab](https://www.iisc-seal.net){:target="_blank"}, developing an automated bug detection [tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yDXlBaWkDwamZoRnZDYTZlNTg/view?usp=drive_link&resourcekey=0-arHXT1Dx5MEKqy6SfSSdKA){:target="_blank"} for Android applications. 
I am also a proud alumna of [IIEST, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, where I did my undergraduate studies. 
During this time, I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate summer intern at [Nomura Research Institute, Kolkata](https://www.nrifintech.com){:target="_blank"}.

Through my work, I strive to create a safer digital environment for all. 
Feel free to connect with me as I explore the world of computer security.
