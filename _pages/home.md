Hello there, I'm Priyanka Mondal. Welcome to my personal website !!  <br> 
Currently I am working towards my PhD at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
I am advised by Prof. Owen Arden and Prof. Ioannis Demertzis. 
My research focuses in the intersection of language-based security, security in distributed systems, 
and applied cryptography. Specifically, I am interested in information flow policies, 
fault tolerant systems and searchable encyption. At UCSC I am an active member of Women in Cybersecurity 
and Women in Science & Engineering, advocating for diversity and excellence in science and technology.<br>
Before joining my PhD, I worked as a software engineer for the networking and Cloud team
at Citrix R&D. Prior to that, I acquired a masters degree from the esteemed Indian Institute of Science, 
where I worked with Prof. Aditya Kanade on Automated bug detection in Android apps. 
I am also proud alumna of the IIEST, Shibpur, where I did my undergraduate studies. 
During this time I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate summer intern at Nomura Fintech. <br>

Through my work, I strive to create a safer digital environment for all, 
where theory and practice go hand in hand. Feel free to connect with me as I explore the 
fascinating world of computer security.
