<b> Hello there, I'm Priyanka !! Welcome to my personal website. </b>  

Currently, I am working towards my PhD at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
I am advised by Prof. Owen Arden and [Prof. Ioannis Demertzis](https://idemertzis.com). 
My research lies in the intersection of language-based security, security in distributed systems, 
and applied cryptography. Specifically, I am interested in information flow policies, 
fault tolerant systems and searchable encyption. At UCSC I am an active member of Women in Cybersecurity 
and Women in Science & Engineering, advocating for diversity and excellence in science and technology.
Before joining UCSC, I worked as a software engineer for the Networking & Cloud team
at Citrix R&D, for two years. Prior to that, I acquired a masters degree from the esteemed Indian Institute of Science, 
where I worked with Prof. Aditya Kanade developing an automated bug detection tool for Android applications. 
I am also a proud alumna of IIEST, Shibpur, where I did my undergraduate studies. 
During this time I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate summer intern at Nomura Fintech. <br>

Through my work, I strive to create a safer digital environment for all. 
Feel free to connect with me as I explore the fascinating world of computer security.
